## Project Goals
<<<<<<< HEAD
Use Random Forest (RF) to detect high-order interaction among genomic, omic features associated with the phenotype. 

## Approach
We use an example dataset with clinical phenotypes and rna-seq expression data for individuals. We apply RF to find the important features. Then, for downstream data exploration, we map the features using gene annotation in NCBI databases and create network representations for the interactions. 

## Results
The performance of feature selections / prediction module will be evaluated based on prediction error. Visualization of the gene networks or protein networks is done using Cytoscape. 

## Future Work
Add more omic features to improve the prediction of our RF model. 
=======
Use machine learning modules to detect high-order interaction among genomic, omic features that associated with the phenotype. 

## Approach
We use an example dataset with clinical phenotypes and rna expression data for indivudals. We apply machine learning modules to find the important features. Then, for downstream data exploration, we map the features using gene annotation in NCBI databases and create network representations for the interactions. 

## Results
The performance of feature selections / prediction module will be evaluable based on prediction error. The purpose of presenting the network of interactions is more for data visualization.
